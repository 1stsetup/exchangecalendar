 * -- Exchange 2007/2010 Calendar and Tasks Provider.
 * -- For Thunderbird with the Lightning add-on.
 *
 * This work is a combination of the Storage calendar, part of the default Lightning add-on, and 
 * the "Exchange Data Provider for Lightning" add-on currently, october 2011, maintained by Simon Schubert.
 * Primarily made because the "Exchange Data Provider for Lightning" add-on is a continuation 
 * of old code and this one is build up from the ground. It still uses some parts from the 
 * "Exchange Data Provider for Lightning" project.
